This is the design system used across most of my (KesvaL) projects. Why do I need this ? Because I'm tired of rewriting the same (S)CSS over and over again, especially for me to change it in the future since I'm bad at designing. I'd rather to just have one dependency to update, and that's it!

## Fonts

You should copy the fonts from the `fonts` folder and serve them at `/fonts/...` on your website. 

## Usage

Feel free to use, copy, modify this. Change the colors as you wish.
