## Advancement
Still working on it. I don't know if I want to actually have default values for things, as how the scss/abstracts/tokens.scss file is made now. I do not think so.

### Defaults

- [x] Button
- [x] Inputs
- [ ] Typography (see tailwind typography and implement)
- [ ] ...

## Description
A design system used across all my projects.

## What's inside
This only declares the colors, fonts and certain components (default styles, no classes required). Also, you can find mixins such as mq (media query), to, well.. media query.

## Components
Things such as a navbar component won't be created because they do not make sense. The navbar will always be different depending on the project I am working on, so there's no point.

## Usage
Feel free to use, copy, modify this. Change the colors as you wish.\\
