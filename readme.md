This is the design system used across most of my (KesvaL) projects. Why do I need this ? Because I'm tired of rewriting the same (S)CSS over and over again, especially for me to change it in the future since I'm bad at designing. I'd rather to just have one dependency to update, and that's it!

## Unused Classes

When using this design system, I am using SvelteKit which cleans all the css for me, so any unused classes are removed. If you are using this yourself but without SvelteKit, you might want to use PostCSS with some plugins to remove the unused classes. Altough Svelte(Kit) is still great, if you've never tried, try it!

## Usage

Feel free to use, copy, modify this. Change the colors as you wish.
